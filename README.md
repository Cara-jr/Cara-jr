# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cara Ren

I'm a 3rd-year **Computer Science** student at the **University of Waterloo** with a passion for software development, and making impactful contributions through software development. I've had the opportunity to work with amazing teams at **Sun Life**, **LTIMindtree**, and **Innocuous AI** as a software developer, gaining hands-on experience in real-world projects.

I'm currently **seeking Summer 2025 internship opportunities** in software development, AI, game development or related fields. I love tackling complex challenges and contributing to projects that drive meaningful change.
