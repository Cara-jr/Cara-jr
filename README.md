# Hi there! 👋 I'm Cara Ren

I'm a 3rd-year **Computing and Financial Management** student at the **University of Waterloo** with a passion for technology, finance, and making impactful contributions through software development. I've had the opportunity to work with amazing teams at **Sun Life**, **LTIMindtree**, and **Innocuous AI** as a software developer, gaining hands-on experience in real-world projects.

I'm currently **seeking Summer 2025 internship opportunities** in software development, or related fields. I love tackling complex challenges and contributing to projects that drive meaningful change.
